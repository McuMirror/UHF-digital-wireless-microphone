# UHF-digital-wireless-microphone

UHF digital wireless microphone based on the arduino DUE and cheap SI446x modules with 26mhz oscillator.

This Code depends on;

Radio modules driver , RadioHead RH_rf24  http://www.airspayce.com/mikem/arduino/RadioHead/classRH__RF24.html
including Custom 200khz RF mask GFSK connfig file fir 26mhz oscilator based modules made with free WDS software

I2S SSC driver for ARduino Due  ArduinoDueHIFI ,  https://github.com/delsauce/ArduinoDueHiFi
LTC Timcode decoding / encoding, libLTC, https://github.com/x42/libltc

IMA_ADPCM audio compression library , http://yxit.co.uk/source/documentation/classIMA__ADPCM.html

It early days, don't expect this code to work at all !!

I will update its status to working if and when i get there.
